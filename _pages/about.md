Within the Core Fulfillment department, I perform research and engineering tasks related to probabilistic delivery time forecasting.

In June 2024, I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/univ-lorraine/">the University of Lorraine</a> where I worked as a Ph.D. Researcher at <a href="https://www.loria.fr/en/">LORIA</a> and <a href="https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/">ERPI</a>. \
My PhD topic is entitled <a href="https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/tel-04687673/">*From Semantic-aware to Semantic-enhanced Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Link Prediction*</a>. \
I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://members.loria.fr/ABrun/">Armelle Brun</a> (LORIA) and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ttiddZkAAAAJ&hl=fr">Davy Monticolo</a> (ERPI).
