## About Myself
Since 2021, I am a PhD Researcher at <a href="https://www.loria.fr/en/">LORIA</a> and <a href="https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/">ERPI</a> in Nancy, France. \
My PhD topic is entitled *Machine Learning and Recommender System for Education: Towards a Decision Support System for University Guidance*. \
I work under the supervision of <a href="https://members.loria.fr/ABrun/">Armelle Brun</a> (LORIA) and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ttiddZkAAAAJ&hl=fr">Davy Monticolo</a> (ERPI).

In 2020, I obtained my engineering diploma from <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version">Ecole Centrale de Nantes</a> (Master's Degree), where I specialized in <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr/engineering-programme-diplome-dingenieur/course-specialisations-yrs-23/mathematics-and-applications">Mathematics and Applications</a> with a focus on Statistics and Machine Learning. The same year, I also graduated from <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en/">Audencia Business School</a> (Master's Degree).
