## About Myself
From September 2024, I will join Zalando SE in Dortmund, Germany, where I will work as an Applied Scientist. Within the Core Fulfillment department, I will perform research and engineering tasks related to probabilistic delivery time forecasting.

In June 2024, I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/univ-lorraine/">the University of Lorraine</a> where I worked as a Ph.D. Researcher at <a href="https://www.loria.fr/en/">LORIA</a> and <a href="https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/">ERPI</a> in Nancy, France. \
My PhD topic is entitled *From Semantic-aware to Semantic-enhanced Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Link Prediction*. \
I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://members.loria.fr/ABrun/">Armelle Brun</a> (LORIA) and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ttiddZkAAAAJ&hl=fr">Davy Monticolo</a> (ERPI).

I was also a Ph.D. Visiting Researcher at the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/">DWS</a> group at the University of Mannheim, where I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=SkSl3NkAAAAJ&hl=en">Heiko Paulheim</a>.

In 2020, I obtained my engineering diploma from <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version">Ecole Centrale de Nantes</a> (Master's Degree), where I specialized in <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr/engineering-programme-diplome-dingenieur/course-specialisations-yrs-23/mathematics-and-applications">Mathematics and Applications</a> with a focus on Statistics and Machine Learning. The same year, I also graduated from <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en/">Audencia Business School</a> where I studied Management-Engineering (Master's Degree).
