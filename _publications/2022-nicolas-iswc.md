Education is a complex domain where students must make their curricula choices carefully. To model the intricacies of the educational domain, ontologies have successfully been leveraged in the past. However, no available ontology or dataset directly addresses the critical transition from high school to university from a decision-making perspective. Therefore, the contribution of our ongoing work is twofold. Firstly, we introduce EducOnto - an ontology that aims at modeling university curricula and students' profiles. Secondly, we introduce EduKG - a knowledge graph inheriting the semantics of EducOnto and instantiated with data about French students and curricula.
